On behalf of Expert Village my name is Andrea
Spano and I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.340
crab cakes from my new book Not Just Desserts.
So as you can see the crab cakes has been

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.670
frying a little bit, I kind of lower them
a little bit while concentrated on my sauce

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.119
I didn't want to burn them. I flip one of
them over as you can see the brown beautiful

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.240
brown color it has I want to flip them all
over and they would continue to brown on the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.940
other side. That was a little to much you
know what the middle of the pan always hotter

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.280
then the sides. Here you go nice and brown,
beautiful and now it is at this point you

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.280
can let them sit in there and you turn off
the heat source so this way they don't over

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.140
cook but you have the nice brown on top, perfectly
done. Now we are going to concentrate on the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.329
finishing of our sauce which as you can see
is reducing we want to get it to the consistency

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.669
so that it is not to watery.
